# Seq2Seq example by pytorch
A sequence-to-sequence model implemented by pytorch and torchtext. This model was designed to translate python into cpp in grammar,
however, the logic error and lacking of datasets blocked the original objective.
This model has been diverted into a translator which translates English into Chinese, yet the results were clearly mistaken.
